# portfolioalban
I like a dark theme for my portfolio utilizing different shades of black and blue while adding red, white and other colors from pictures for contrast. I want adequate use of empty space to not overwhelm the user with information but also to keep them interested. There is a navigation bar at the top of the home page that takes the user to different pages and would follow along. I was able to put all the content onto the pages but still need more time to fix the style and functionality of them.
